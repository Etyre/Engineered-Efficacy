#Learning Methodology



###Deliberate Practice Heuristics and Strategies


####First do it right, then do it smooth, then do it quiet, then do it fast

####Finding Control Systems

Examples:

- Touch typing - 

####Use a more sensitive instrument

Epistemic status: 

Find a version of the task or exercise that accentuates or amplifies your errors. This gives you stronger feedback on small errors and forces you to decrease your margin of error.

Examples:

- Juggling - Use lighter balls, which are harder to control, because they will deviate more from their trajectories from minute discrepancies in their throws.



####Stair-stepping
Epistemic status:

Alternate between a harder version and an easier version of the same exercise

Examples:

- Juggling - Alternate between juggling with easier, heavier balls, and harder, lighter balls


###Study Huristics and Strategies

The point of reading is *to have new thoughts*.



####Visual/ Kinesthetic Metaphors




- "Why does this matter?"
- "How could I practice this?"
- "How would I use this?"
- "What's an example of this in my own life?"

####Incremental reading


Always always change _something_. I don't allow myself to move on from a block until I have added something new, either a question, or a compression, or at least a note. If I have nothing whatsoever to change, then I remove the "#IR" tag.




#####Posing open ended questions




The answers can then be trimmed down to be the answers to anki cards.
