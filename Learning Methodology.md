###Deliberate Practice Heuristics and Strategies


####First do it right, then do it smooth, then do it quiet, then do it fast

Epistemic status:

####What gets measured gets managed

Maintaining an a focused intention is easier said than done. All to often I'll set out to practice some specific sub-skill or to focus on some specific aspect of a practice, only to implicitly be motivated to focus on something else, or to slide into mindless repetition.

(Link to my thing about inner intention and outer intention?)

The simplest way that I know of to address this is to simply track and record your performance at the specific metric at which I want to improve. Somehow, doing this incentives the part of me that directs my inner intention.

Examples:

* Touch Typing: I was "focusing on accuracy" for (weeks? months?) with my touch typing, but inevitably I would feel some pressure / temptation to go fast. This is unsurprising, since I was recording my speeds for each trial. Even if I was wanting to slow down and focus on accuracy, I was hedonically rewarded for fast trial times. Only after I started recording my accuracy scores in the spreadsheet, did that become my actual in-the-moment target, and did my accuracy improve. (link)
* Juggling: I was plateauing with juggling for more than a month. I did a session in which I logged how long, in minutes, I was able to hold the juggling pattern for. In that session, I broke 60 seconds (for the first time) multiple times, and my best time was 50% than my record-to-date. (link)

####Finding Control Systems

Epistemic status:

Examples:

- Touch typing - 
- Juggling -

####Identify earlier and more subtle gradients / feedback mechanisms; make smaller earlier corrections

Epistemic status:


- Juggling: noticing it landing on my palm

####Do a smaller thing, with greater ease-ness

If the exercise that I've selected for myself feels frustrating, then it isn't the right exercise yet.


####What you can't control, just predict






####Use a more sensitive instrument

Epistemic status: 

Find a version of the task or exercise that accentuates or amplifies your errors. This gives you stronger feedback on small errors and forces you to decrease your margin of error.

Examples:

- Juggling - Use lighter balls, which are harder to control, because they will deviate more from their trajectories from minute discrepancies in their throws.

####Find proprioceptive one-ness

####Stair-stepping
Epistemic status:

Alternate between a harder version and an easier version of the same exercise

Examples:

- Juggling - Alternate between juggling with easier, heavier balls, and harder, lighter balls


###Study Heuristics and Strategies

The point of reading is *to have new thoughts*.



####Visual/ Kinesthetic Metaphors




- "Why does this matter?"
- "How could I practice this?"
- "How would I use this?"
- "What's an example of this in my own life?"

####Incremental reading

Always always change _something_. I don't allow myself to move on from a block until I have added something new, either a question, or a compression, or at least a note. If I have nothing whatsoever to change, then I remove the "#IR" tag.




#####Posing open ended questions

The answers can then be trimmed down to be the answers to anki cards.
