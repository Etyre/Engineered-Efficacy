###Deliberate Practice Heuristics and Strategies

- Focus intently 
- Find the limits of your ability
- Fix your errors
- Feedback



####Focus

I my juggling times are noticeably weaker when I'm distracted by other things on my mind, such as an essay that I'm writing in my head, or additions that I want to make to this document.


####First do it right, then do it smooth, then do it quiet, then do it fast

Epistemic status:

####What gets measured gets managed

Maintaining an a focused intention is easier said than done. All to often I'll set out to practice some specific sub-skill or to focus on some specific aspect of a practice, only to implicitly be motivated to focus on something else, or to slide into mindless repetition.

(Link to my thing about inner intention and outer intention?)

The simplest way that I know of to address this is to simply track and record your performance at the specific metric at which I want to improve. Somehow, doing this incentives the part of me that directs my inner intention.

Importantly, *just* setting up tracking is usually not sufficient. I still need to intentionally make a point to on the activity and have the intention of succeeding at the activity. I still have to try.

Examples:

* Touch Typing: I was "focusing on accuracy" for (weeks? months?) with my touch typing, but inevitably I would feel some pressure / temptation to go fast. This is unsurprising, since I was recording my speeds for each trial. Even if I was wanting to slow down and focus on accuracy, I was hedonically rewarded for fast trial times. Only after I started recording my accuracy scores in the spreadsheet, did that become my actual in-the-moment target, and did my accuracy improve. (link)
* Juggling: I was plateauing with juggling for more than a month. I did a session in which I logged how long, in minutes, I was able to hold the juggling pattern for. In that session, I broke 60 seconds (for the first time) multiple times, and my best time was 50% than my record-to-date. (link)

####Smaller, even smaller

Juggling: I could juggle at all, but the arcs that the balls were traveling were not smooth or consistent. I knew that I should back up to practicing tossing only one ball, one at a time, in a consistent arc, but I despaired of this actually working - it felt like I could do hundreds of repetitions without improving at all. 


That despair was a hint that I hadn't chunked out the exercise enough. I thought that I couldn't get any more basic than that at controlling the trajectory of the ball. But actually I needed have backed up even further, to just throwing the ball straight up in the air, at a consistent height, and catching it, or to throwing it at a target on the ground. [2021-09-18 note: I still need to do this, actually]

####Finding Control Systems

Epistemic status:

Examples:

- **Touch typing** - In learning touch typing at speed, I learned to [notice when I was rushing](https://efficacyengineering.wordpress.com/2020/07/26/my-current-phenomenological-model-of-my-typing-skill/), and slow down to focus on precision, and to notice when things felt smooth, so that [I could push more oomph into it](`https://efficacyengineering.wordpress.com/2020/07/26/my-current-phenomenological-model-of-my-typing-skill/`). Combined, these created a kind of control system of keeping the "intensity" in line with my structure, without getting ahead of myself, or rushing. [note that that isn't exactly what the first link describes, though it does match my memory]
- **Juggling** - Noticing the balls deviating somewhat from that pattern, and focusing on making "adjustments" that to bring the pattern back in line. 

####Identify earlier and more subtle gradients / feedback mechanisms; make smaller earlier corrections

Epistemic status:


- Juggling: I could tell when I missed a catch or dropped a ball, but by that point it was already too late to do a correction, and the pattern would collapse. But I noticed that I would catch the ball with different parts of my hand, sometimes between my fingers, sometimes on the ridge between my thumb and forefinger, sometimes on my palm. When I caught the ball with my fingers, I would typically loose control of the pattern a few steps latter. But, this was early enough that I could do the correction: making sure to catch with my palm on the next iteration. 

####Do a smaller thing, with greater ease-ness

If the exercise that I've selected for myself feels frustrating, then it isn't the right exercise yet.


####What you can't control, just predict



Juggling - If I'm trying to throw a ball up in the air and hit a target (or my foot, since then I have immediate feedback without needing to look), and I'm finding that this is really hard, I can start by throwing the ball at the target, and trying to predict, after it leaves my hand, but before it lands, if the ball will hit the target. Oftentimes I will be able to feel that a throw was "good" or "off", which attunes me to that feedback mechanism. And sometimes, I'll be *surprised*, I expect a throw to land, and it doesn't, or vis versa, which allows me to refine my feeling of what "good" feels like.


####Use a more sensitive instrument

Epistemic status: 

Find a version of the task or exercise that accentuates or amplifies your errors. This gives you stronger feedback on small errors and forces you to decrease your margin of error.

Examples:

- Juggling - Use lighter balls, which are harder to control, because they will deviate more from their trajectories from minute discrepancies in their throws.

####Find proprioceptive one-ness

####Stair-stepping
Epistemic status:

Alternate between a harder version and an easier version of the same exercise

Examples:

- Juggling - Alternate between juggling with easier, heavier balls, and harder, lighter balls.


####Intense focus without tension






###Study Heuristics and Strategies

The point of reading is *to have new thoughts*.



####Visual/ Kinesthetic Metaphors




- "Why does this matter?"
- "How could I practice this?"
- "How would I use this?"
- "What's an example of this in my own life?"

####Incremental reading

Always always change _something_. I don't allow myself to move on from a block until I have added something new, either a question, or a compression, or at least a note. If I have nothing whatsoever to change, then I remove the "#IR" tag.




#####Posing open ended questions

The answers can then be trimmed down to be the answers to anki cards.
