Notes on how to read this document

I'll try to clearly distinguish between specific techniques or strategies that I find helpful (for which one's metaphorical milage may vary) and general underlying principles, which I expect to be relevant across people.

##Being Resourced

###Sleep

By far the most important behavior for maintaining high energy is sufficient high quality sleep. While I have some tricks for maintaining high focus and momentum even when sleep deprived, the number one most important thing for sustaining high output is to get regular, good sleep. 

[stuff on the benefits of sleep?]

As a sort of propagating urges, I think about sleep as akin to a practice for renewing my connection with the Force (ala star wars). I’m so much crisper and clearer when I am well rested, that it is as if I have a connection to some extra-material energy field, allowing me to be aware of more, think faster, and respond better, and move with deliberateness. 

There are two parts to getting good sleep: strategies for falling asleep quickly and reliably, and ways to improve sleep quality, conditional on falling asleep in the first place.

####Factors for high quality sleep

#####Light and Darkness

I've found that if there is a small amount of sunlight leakage into the room that I'm sleeping in, I’ll spend the whole day slightly groggy.

So if I'm on a schedule where my sleep period overlaps with the sun being up, I make sure to throughly light-insulate my room.

In contrast, I usually walk around the block first thing in the morning (while I brush my teeth), to expose myself to light 

#####Timing

Light first thing

Inner wake up call

Spring out of bed

#####Temperature


Sauna 

Cold showers

#####Ventilation and CO2

#####Ease of peeing

This sounds kind of silly. I have sometimes find that I sleep badly because I’ll wake up in the middle of the night with a full bladder. I should get up and pee, but because there are a number of steps between me and the bathroom (maybe I need to put on a robe, or navigate around a desk that I can’t see well in the dark), I have an aversion to getting up, and I just stay there in bed and then fall back into (uncomfortable) sleep. 

But I can circumvent this with future pacing. I’ll practice, when I’m awake, the steps that I need to take to go pee, so that when I wake up in the middle of the night, that’s the default action.

###Exercise

After sleep, the most important habit / behavior pattern for maintaining high energy is sufficient regular exercise. When I am exercising intensely enough, regularly, I feel more alert and energetic.

####Intensity

How much is “enough”? As a heuristic, I want to exercise hard enough that I break a sweat *or* I am at least a little bit sore the next day. 

####Regularity

In practice, it doesn't seem to make that much of a difference if I skip exercise for one day. But, if I go 3 or 4 days without being active, I'll tend to feel slightly slugish or generally unmotivated. And from this state, going to exercise feels more onerous. So I make a point to exercise almost every day, 

Miss once, but never miss twice. 

####What kind of exercise?

Years, ago, I was listening a podcast (the Freakenomics podcast?), in which they interviewed some expert on exercise and health, and he said something that stuck with me:

“The optimal kind of exercise is whatever you will actually do.”

The difference, in health, cognitive, and longevity outcomes, between exercising regularly and not is much larger than the difference between some form of exercise and some theoretically more efficient form of exercise. It is much more effective to find ways to exercise that you actually like than it is try and find the most efficient kind, since you’re more likely to form a habit around the exercise that you actually like.

I prefer forms of exercise that do not demand constant attention / exertion of will power  over the course of the activity. Practices for which, once I show up and start, the default is to keep going. 

Strength training is like this for me: once I’ve started I don’t really need to force myself to keep going, there’s a kind of rhythm to it, where as (again) for me, running feels like a continuous slog where I have to keep deciding not to stop. Juggling and playing beat-saber are similar.

Personally, my main exercise is Barbell training (squats, deadlifts, shoulder presses, bent over rows, bench press), and bodyweight exercises (pullups, chinups). I also often play beatsaber, which is super fun, with weights on my arms.

I find that squats are particularly important for some reason.


####Lowering activation energy to exercise

Exercise is the most important of the things that I aim to do just about every day. I want the transition to exercise to be a smooth and easy. As such it is worth it to debug and clear away any, even very slight, aversion or impediment to going to train. 

#####Debugging systemic aversions to exercise

The following are examples of slight / subtle aversions that turned out to be at root of a disinclination to exercise, and how I debugged them.

“My squat has been feeling weird and I have some fear that I’m hurting myself” -> I booked a session with a personal trainer to check my form

“I’m afraid to push my limit because I don’t have a spotter” -> I purchased spotter arms 

“It’s too hot out” -> I got a fan, and also switched to exercising at night

“It’s cold out” -> I started running and playing beatsaber instead of weight lifting.

#####Booting up

Occasionally, for one reason or another, I'll have fallen out of my regular rhythm, and I won't have exercised in a week or more. As noted, this is a kind of positive feedback system: when I'm in an equilibrium where I'm not exercising, going to exercise feels particularly onerous, but when I'm exercising regularly, going to exercise will usually feel attractive.

So when I'm attempting to boot up from one equilibrium to another, I'll try to find the easiest and most attractive form of exercise, to lower the required activation energy as much as possible. In practice this usually means playing beatsaber. 

#####Action Chunking

Sometimes, I will hit my trigger to go out an exercise (what the trigger is might vary day by day, but often it is my first work break), and I just won’t feel like it.

In this situation I default to “action chunking”: I’ll ask “what’s the smallest proximal next action that I need to do to go strength train?”, and then visualize that next step in my head. I find that just visualizing the action, over and over, tends to cause me to get up and execute the action. 

[Note: this seems related to unbundling clarification and execution]

For instance, if I’m sitting on the couch in the office, the first step to going to exercise is to stand up and press the button on the elevator. 

Or maybe the first thing that I need to do is walk into my room to put on socks. So I would visualize myself standing up, walking into that room, and looking in the directions of the socks.

Action chunking is usually sufficient to lower the activation energy to starting a chain of actions. And unless I have some particular aversion to exercising (see above), this causes me to flow into exercises. It snowballs, starting from a very minor action into pretty effortful (but natural-default) activity.

Like everything else, of course, the transition function for exercise is made more reliable by future pacing it. [link]

#####Amping up Pushing past dragginess

Sometimes I’ll be particularly tired or draggy, on a day, but I want to exercise anyway. To counteract my disinclination to exert myself, I’ll use my activation process to get into a slightly high-arousal mode. 

	**Activation Process:**
	
	1. 40 Pushups
	2. 3 sets of Bellows Breathing (20 breaths a set) 

Then, between sets, I’ll pace and take deep moderately-paced nasal breaths, to maintain a somewhat heightened level of physiological arousal. 

-------

In addition to all of the above, I have a policy that I don’t eat a second meal of the day unless I have done some exercise, even if it is just pullups.
