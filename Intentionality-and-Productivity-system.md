###Sleep

By far the most important behavior for maintaining high energy is sufficient high quality sleep. While I have some tricks for maintaining high focus and momentum even when sleep deprived, the number one most important thing for sustaining high output is to get regular, good sleep. 

[stuff on the benefits of sleep?]

As a sort of propagating urges, I think about sleep as akin to a practice for renewing my connection with the Force (ala star wars). I’m so much crisper and clearer when I am well rested, that it is as if I have a connection to some extra-material energy field, allowing me to be aware of more, think faster, and respond better, and move with deliberateness. 

There are two parts to getting good sleep: strategies for falling asleep quickly and reliably, and ways to improve sleep quality, conditional on falling asleep in the first place.

####Factors for high quality sleep

#####Light and Darkness

I've found that if there is a small amount of sunlight leakage into the room that I'm sleeping in, I’ll spend the whole day slightly groggy.

So if I'm on a schedule where my sleep period overlaps with the sun being up, I make sure to throughly light-insulate my room.

In contrast, I usually walk around the block first thing in the morning (while I brush my teeth), to expose myself to light
