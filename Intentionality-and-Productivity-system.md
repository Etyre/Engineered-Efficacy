##Overview
[I'm going to come back and write the overview last.]

###What this document is

###High Level View of this system

Two broad mutually supportive struts or parts: Being resourced and Habits for guiding my attention. 

###Notes on reading this document

- I'll try to clearly distinguish between specific techniques or strategies that I find helpful (for which one's metaphorical milage may vary) and general underlying principles, which I expect to be relevant across people.

- When I cite academic evidence, I'll note if that evidence is a crux for me or not, and I'll note if the academic evidence 

##Being Resourced



In earlier versions of this model, I mapped out specific psychological states that were necessary for sustaining high output. But I've mostly decided 

- Energy

- Spaciousness / reflectiveness / the opposite of driveness

###Sleep

By far the most important behavior for maintaining high energy is sufficient high quality sleep. While I have some tricks for maintaining high focus and momentum even when sleep deprived, the number one most important thing for sustaining high output is to get regular, good sleep. 

[stuff on the benefits of sleep?]

As a sort of propagating urges, I think about sleep as akin to a practice for renewing my connection with the Force (ala star wars). I’m so much crisper and clearer when I am well rested, that it is as if I have a connection to some extra-material energy field, allowing me to be aware of more, think faster, and respond better, and move with deliberateness. 

There are two parts to getting good sleep: strategies for falling asleep quickly and reliably, and ways to improve sleep quality, conditional on falling asleep in the first place.

####Factors for high quality sleep

#####Light and Darkness

I've found that if there is a small amount of sunlight leakage into the room that I'm sleeping in, I’ll spend the whole day slightly groggy.

So if I'm on a schedule where my sleep period overlaps with the sun being up, I make sure to throughly light-insulate my room.

In contrast, I usually walk around the block first thing in the morning (while I brush my teeth), to expose myself to light 

#####Cold

My current posit is that the principle factor for the depth and quality of sleep is my core body temperature during the night. The colder I am, the better I sleep. 

######Ambient temperature

The most straightforward way to cool down my body at night is to sleep in a very cold room, I guess around 65 to 70 degrees ferinheight. (Note: I could actually check with my sleep data from 2020, in which ambient temperature is one of the things that I randomized.)

However, I currently don't have temperature control over the room that I sleep in. I make up for this with a big fan, right behind my head, that blows in the direction of my feet. (Note: It stands to reason that the sound of the fan is hurting my sleep quality. I might want to check this out. If need be, I guess I could get a several of those pink noise fans.) This also helps with airflow and ventilation [see the next section.]

I've also used a chilipad a various points, but I didn't notice that much of a benefit from it. (I might want to reassess this.)

######Physiological hacks

Beyond simply being in a cold place, I think that you can lower your core night-time body temperature by using your body's homeostatic responses.

Four things that I'm experimenting with

- Taking saunas in the evening
- Taking warm showers right before bed
- Taking cold showers right before bed
- Taking alternating warm-cold showers right before bed. 

#####Ventilation and CO2

I'm told that CO2 buildup in the air compromises cognition, and that CO2 build up in the room you're sleeping in can lead to grogginess or low energy during the day.

I haven't tested that myself, but I also crack a window in the room that I sleep in.

######Mouthtaping


#####Ease of peeing

This sounds kind of silly, but I have sometimes find that I sleep badly because I’ll wake up in the middle of the night with a full bladder. I should get up and pee, but because there are a number of steps between me and the bathroom (maybe I need to put on a robe, or navigate around a desk that I can’t see well in the dark), I have an aversion to getting up, and I just stay there in bed and then fall back into an uncomfortable, restless sleep. 

I can circumvent this via future-pacing and rehearsal. I’ll practice, when I’m awake, the steps that I need to take to go pee. Then when I wake up in the middle of the night, that’s the default action.

#####Mattress?

It stands to reason that I would sleep better with a high quality mattress, but I haven't really investigated that yet.

#####Supplements

I currently take [dose] of melatonin shortly before going to bed.

Gwern’s page says it all. [link]

However, Andrew Huberman suggests [link], that I should instead be taking the following: 

####Falling asleep

When I'm not falling asleep this is either because circadian is off or sleep drive is off or I have conflicted intentions.

#####Timing




#####Waking up

######Inner wake up call

######Spring out of bed

######Light first thing


#####When I'm restless

######Journal

######Meditate

######Drink Soylent 

###Exercise

After sleep, the most important habit / behavior pattern for maintaining high energy is sufficient regular exercise. When I am exercising intensely enough, regularly, I feel more alert and energetic.

####Intensity

How much is “enough”? As a heuristic, I want to exercise hard enough that I break a sweat *or* I am at least a little bit sore the next day. 

####Regularity

In practice, it doesn't seem to make that much of a difference if I skip exercise for one day. But, if I go 3 or 4 days without being active, I'll tend to feel slightly slugish or generally unmotivated. And from this state, going to exercise feels more onerous. So I make a point to exercise almost every day, 

Miss once, but never miss twice. 

####What kind of exercise?

Years, ago, I was listening a podcast (the Freakenomics podcast?), in which they interviewed some expert on exercise and health, and he said something that stuck with me:

“The optimal kind of exercise is whatever you will actually do.”

The difference, in health, cognitive, and longevity outcomes, between exercising regularly and not is much larger than the difference between some form of exercise and some theoretically more efficient form of exercise. It is much more effective to find ways to exercise that you actually like than it is try and find the most efficient kind, since you’re more likely to form a habit around the exercise that you actually like.

I prefer forms of exercise that do not demand constant attention / exertion of will power  over the course of the activity. Practices for which, once I show up and start, the default is to keep going. 

Strength training is like this for me: once I’ve started I don’t really need to force myself to keep going, there’s a kind of rhythm to it, where as (again) for me, running feels like a continuous slog where I have to keep deciding not to stop. Juggling and playing beat-saber are similar.

Personally, my main exercise is Barbell training (squats, deadlifts, shoulder presses, bent over rows, bench press), and bodyweight exercises (pullups, chinups). I also often play beatsaber, which is super fun, with weights on my arms.

I find that squats are particularly important for some reason.


####Lowering activation energy to exercise

Exercise is the most important of the things that I aim to do just about every day. I want the transition to exercise to be a smooth and easy. As such it is worth it to debug and clear away any, even very slight, aversion or impediment to going to train. 

#####Debugging systemic aversions to exercise

The following are examples of slight / subtle aversions that turned out to be at root of a disinclination to exercise, and how I debugged them.

“My squat has been feeling weird and I have some fear that I’m hurting myself” -> I booked a session with a personal trainer to check my form

“I’m afraid to push my limit because I don’t have a spotter” -> I purchased spotter arms 

“It’s too hot out” -> I got a fan, and also switched to exercising at night

“It’s cold out” -> I started running and playing beatsaber instead of weight lifting.

#####Booting up from not exercising equilibrium

Occasionally, for one reason or another, I'll have fallen out of my regular rhythm, and I won't have exercised in a week or more. As noted, this is a kind of positive feedback system: when I'm in an equilibrium where I'm not exercising, going to exercise feels particularly onerous, but when I'm exercising regularly, going to exercise will usually feel attractive.

So when I'm attempting to boot up from one equilibrium to another, I'll try to find the easiest and most attractive form of exercise, to lower the required activation energy as much as possible. In practice this usually means playing beatsaber. 

#####Action Chunking

Sometimes, I will hit my trigger to go out an exercise (what the trigger is might vary day by day, but often it is my first work break), and I just won’t feel like it.

In this situation I default to “action chunking”: I’ll ask “what’s the smallest proximal next action that I need to do to go strength train?”, and then visualize that next step in my head. I find that just visualizing the action, over and over, tends to cause me to get up and execute the action. 

[Note: this seems related to unbundling clarification and execution]

For instance, if I’m sitting on the couch in the office, the first step to going to exercise is to stand up and press the button on the elevator. 

Or maybe the first thing that I need to do is walk into my room to put on socks. So I would visualize myself standing up, walking into that room, and looking in the directions of the socks.

Action chunking is usually sufficient to lower the activation energy to starting a chain of actions. And unless I have some particular aversion to exercising (see above), this causes me to flow into exercises. It snowballs, starting from a very minor action into pretty effortful (but natural-default) activity.

Like everything else, of course, the transition function for exercise is made more reliable by future pacing it. [link]

#####Amping up Pushing past dragginess

Sometimes I’ll be particularly tired or draggy, on a day, but I want to exercise anyway. To counteract my disinclination to exert myself, I’ll use my activation process to get into a slightly high-arousal mode. 

	**Activation Process:**
	
	1. 40 Pushups
	2. 3 sets of Bellows Breathing (20 breaths a set) 

Then, between sets, I’ll pace and take deep moderately-paced nasal breaths, to maintain a somewhat heightened level of physiological arousal. 

-------

In addition to all of the above, I have a policy that I don’t eat a second meal of the day unless I have done some exercise, even if it is just pullups. 

###Rest days

I didn't used to take explicit rest days. But I experimented with it, on the advise of Anna Salamon, and the difference in how I felt was noticeable. Remember, we are aiming for effective modes, not effective traits. If you never give yourself explicit time to rest (or don’t give yourself enough time), then you’ll tend to slack off during your work time. You want your work time to be high quality, which means supporting that work time with explicit rest time. These days, I take a rest day at least once a week.

In my parlance, a rest day is a day where I steer mainly by the question “what would be most nourishing right now?” / I don’t do anything that I don’t viscerally feel like doing, from the time I wake up to the time that I go to sleep (modulo taking a little bit of time in the evening to do a daily review and plan my next day).

I don’t exactly avoid using will power, since for instance, I might strength train hard, which does require some amount of will power, but it still feels “soft” or something.

Personally, on rest days I will often:

* Meditate
* Strength train
* go on walks
* Cook my own food
* Make music
* Start new side projects
* Read comic books
* Watch movies

The day after a rest day, the feeling of refreshedness is palpable. I subjectively feel more alert, and responsive, and energetic, and it is easier to focus.

####Theory

I’m not sure what the “active ingredient” of rest days are. I will sometimes spend much of a rest day doing pretty intense cognitive work on some side project, but nevertheless, I’ll feel notably refreshed the next day. This makes me think that the core thing is something like “dropping my psychological commitments” (in the GTD sense of the word “commitment”). Where usually some part of my mind is tracking all the things that need to happen and that I want to do, on a rest day, anytime a commitment “pings” me, I respond with “that’s not my responsibility today.”

[link to ‘pause your feedback loops’]

It is also possible that the active ingredient is just that I’m doing different things on rest days than on work days, 

[Dig deeper into intrinsic and extrinsic motivation and how it relates to energy levels.]

I haven’t figured out the optimal cadence of rest days yet. Presumably there is some frequency that maximizes my output, and I could find this number by simple binary search.

[link to ‘weekend Wednesdays’]

####Prerestday space clearing

Because I want to turn off my sense of stress and pressure for a day, I need to explicitly process everything and put them all in their places, before the rest day starts. The goal is to deal with everything urgent, and make plans for the next workday, to deal with everything else.

#####Pre Rest day checklist:

1. Preparation (must be day before)
	1. Process personal email
	2. Process CFAR email
	3. Process reminders
	4. Process distraction notes
	5. Do a check for dangling threads / open loops. Deal with them, schedule them, or put them in a process.
	6. Schedule my next rest day.
